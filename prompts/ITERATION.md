# Prompt Iteration Log

Record v1→v2 changes with Failed Path / Resolution / Validation.

## boundary_arbiter: v1 → v2 (regex fallback + prompt hardening)

- **Failed Path**: Initial regex `ITEM\s+\d+` matched inline cross-references like
  "see Item 1 above" as segment headers, causing false boundary splits mid-paragraph.
  Additionally, `v1_boundary_arbiter.txt` lacked explicit constraint against summarization,
  leading to potential token ratio violations when arbiter is invoked.
- **Resolution**: Anchored `HEADER_RE` to line-start (`(?m)^[ \t]*`) in `segment.py`;
  added negative-sample assertions in `test_regex_boundary_fallback.py` to reject
  body-inline mentions. Longer item IDs match first (e.g. "10" before "1").
  Promoted to `prompts/v2_boundary_arbiter.txt` adding: ratio constraint (≥0.85),
  trailing whitespace rule, and explicit negative constraints for numerical preservation.
- **Validation**: `test_regex_boundary_fallback` green — negative sample
  `"see Item 1 above"` no longer produces a segment hit; `pytest -m unit` all pass.

## incorporation_by_reference: Citi Items 10–14

- **Failed Path**: Pipeline initially reported Items 10–14 as `extracted` with full text
  that was actually just a one-line incorporation notice, misleading eval metrics.
- **Resolution**: Added `detect_incorporation()` in `task2_sec/pipeline/incorporation.py`
  using regex to detect "incorporated by reference" language; status set to
  `incorporated_by_reference` with `text=None` to avoid hallucinating content.
- **Validation**: `test_item_status::test_incorporation_by_reference_no_fake_fulltext` green;
  `test_sec_manifest_citi_incorporation` confirms Items 10 and 14 correctly flagged.

## agent_recovery: v1 → v2 (classified routing vs blind retry)

- **Failed Path**: Initial agent design used a generic `try/except → retry` loop. Same
  recovery action was attempted repeatedly (e.g. re-clicking the same missing element),
  burning LLM calls without progress and triggering `MaxLLMCalls` breaker.
  `v1_recovery.txt` was a flat instruction with no failure-type awareness.
- **Resolution**: Introduced `FailureType` enum + `STRATEGY_TABLE` in `recovery.py`.
  `get_next_strategy(failure_type, attempted)` returns the next *untried* strategy;
  `MAX_RECOVERY_PER_STEP = 2` caps retries. `prompt_loader.load_prompt("recovery",
  variant=failure_type)` injects the matching SOP fragment from `prompts/sops/recovery.md`.
  Promoted to `prompts/v2_recovery.txt` with per-failure-type strategy options,
  explicit "do NOT repeat" constraint, and JSON-only output format.
- **Validation**: `test_recovery_routing` (9 assertions) green — `ACTION_NO_EFFECT` returns
  different strategies on each call; exhausted strategies return `None`; `CAPTCHA_OR_LOGIN`
  always returns `blocked`. L2 `test_agent_recovery_loop` confirms recovery→success and
  exhaustion→failed paths work end-to-end.
  New L2 `test_verify_blind_critic_gate` confirms critic NO → run fails (silent_failure=0).

## agent_plan: v1 → v2 (multi-step execution + result extraction)

- **Failed Path**: v1 agent treated step 0 (navigation) as potentially task-complete — if
  the page loaded and verify passed, the loop broke immediately. This meant search tasks
  (DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia) and extraction tasks (Hacker News top story) would always fail
  because the agent never interacted with the page beyond loading it. Output was limited
  to status only (success/failed), with no task-specific result.
- **Resolution**: Redesigned loop in `loop.py` — step 0 ALWAYS continues to LLM planning;
  steps 1+ use `_plan_next_action()` to determine actions (click, type, scroll, etc.) and
  declare `done=true` with a `result` field only when the task is genuinely complete.
  Updated `AgentAction` schema with `result: str` field. Updated `v1_agent_plan.txt` to
  instruct: "do NOT set done=true just because the page loaded; fill result when done."
- **Validation**: All 58 tests pass (46 unit + 12 integration); `test_agent_recovery_loop`
  and `test_verify_blind_critic_gate` confirm multi-step flow works correctly with
  recovery and Blind Critic gate. Train success rate improved from 4/6 → 6/6.
